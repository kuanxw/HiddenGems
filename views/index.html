		<p>
			Need to know the best locations around you? Hidden Gems is an interactive map that shows the top rated locations in an area. Ratings are based on user input, and the top locations will pop up on the map depending on the scale. Each scale of the map has a threshold for ratings which allows only the highest-rated locations to be visible. This project was created at the UCLA Hack on the Hill on November 12, 2017.
